### TC Members

TC consists of a chair and multiple members. The total number of TC members, including the chair, is five to nine. The chair and members of the first TC of the openGauss open source community are appointed by the openGauss community initiator. All these TC members have made significant contributions to the openGauss community and are committed to intensifying their efforts for a better community. The first TC consists of the following seven members:

* tianwengang[[@pikeTWG](https://gitee.com/pikeTWG)]    # Chair
* liguoliang[[@guoliang_li](https://gitee.com/guoliang_li)]
* lishifu[[@lishifu_db](https://gitee.com/lishifu_db)]
* caiyajie[[@cyj10727](https://gitee.com/cyj10727)]

* huangkaiyao[[@huangkaiyao](https://gitee.com/huangkaiyao)]
* zhoupinggao[[@zankyfun4](https://gitee.com/zankyfun4)]

The term of a TC member is one year. One month before the term expires, the TC member is re-appointed by the openGauss initiator. If a TC member applies for leaving the post due to personal reasons, notify all TC members. According to the decision made at the regular TC meeting, TC members who fail to fulfill the commitment to the community can be forced to leave.

### TC Meeting and Decision-Making Mechanism

The community holds a TC meeting on a weekly basis to discuss and make decisions on the affairs of the community and SIGs. If decisions need to be made on the regular TC meeting, the meeting can be held only when more than half of the TC members (the TC president must be present) attend the meeting. The decision-making is effective when more than half of the attendees approve. In the event of a tie, the TC chair has the veto on this affair.
The meeting agenda and information on how to attend the meeting will be notified in the e-mail list of the community at least three working days before the meeting.

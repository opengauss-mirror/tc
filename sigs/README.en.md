# Special Interest Group (SIG)

* The objective of the SIG is to establish community projects for one or more specific topics and promote the delivery of each project. The establishment of each SIG must be approved by the TC, and governance rules for the SIG should be formulated to specify the responsibilities of the SIG. The content includes but is not limited to the scope of responsibility, communication mode, appointment and removal of maintenance personnel (such as the maintainer and committer), and scope of service (such as the code library and directory). In addition, the information on the internal communication of each SIG must be disclosed in the openGauss community, ensuring that the community members of other SIGs can find the records of discussion, meeting, and decision-making.
  
* The members of each SIG should consist of one or two maintainers, multiple committers and contributors. The first SIGs in the openGauss community are as follows:
